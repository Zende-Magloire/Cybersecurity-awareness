Are personalized lessons more effective at increasing security awareness in comparison to educational videos?

measure variables: learning (include behavior), security anxiety, motivation
random assign: intervention (lessons), no intervention (videos)
measure variables: learning (include behavior), security anxiety, motivation

Pre-test post-test 
Random assignment to experimental condition: Experimental (personalized lesson), control (videos)

To do:
1. Research methods to measure variables.
-----Try to find previous research, see how much chat can do
2. Research most important security awareness topics
-----Prompt chat to decide on topics, compare with previous research
*Use chat gpt to produce test cases to measure behavior*
3. Create pre-test questions:
-----Prompt chat to come up with questions based on topics decided on (20?)
4. Come up with the best "tree" based on responses (30?)
-----Prompt chat to create personalized lesson based on the topics and progress based on user response (actively)
-----Prompt chat to create a short lesson after every wrong answer(specific to the wrong answer)
5. Create post-test questions (20)
-----Prompt chat to come up with essentially the same questions presented in a different way
6. Find short, informative videos
-----Find videos that educate on those topics

After thoughts:
Will this survey be too much/too long for the average college student?
Request to be extra credit for students in psych courses? POSSIBLE
