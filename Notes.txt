Pre-test post-test 
Random assignment to experimental condition: Experimental (personalized lesson), control (videos)

To do:
Research methods to measure variables.
Research most important security awareness topics
Find short, informative videos
Come up with the best "tree" based on responses:

-At the end of each topic, play a video if user got most questions wrong

After thoughts:
Will this survey be too much/too long for the average college student?
Request to be extra credit for students in psych courses? POSSIBLE
