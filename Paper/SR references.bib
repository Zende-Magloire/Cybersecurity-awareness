abstract = {Electronic data breaches and internet “hacking” are common threats to individuals' security, frequently reported in news media. Our aim was to determine the anxiety and stress associated with possible internet hacking. We utilized an online survey, sampling 304 adult participants. We assessed resting anxiety – that is, “worry, anxiety, or stress” reported at the beginning of the survey. We also assessed anxiety related to possible data breaches. Internet hacking (or “Data breach”) anxiety was rated with somewhat greater severity than resting anxiety. Higher resting anxiety was not related to data breach-related anxiety, indicating that data breach anxiety is specific. Demographic characteristics and secure online practices were not associated with internet hacking anxiety. Anxiety related to data breaches is important to study. However, behaviors intended to protect internet security are rare; education and intervention is needed to reduce anxiety and increase internet security.}

abstract = {This paper reports a study investigating the relationship between Internet identification, Internet anxiety and Internet use. The participants were 446 students (319 females and 127 males) from two universities in the UK and one university in Australia. Measures of Internet identification and Internet anxiety were developed. The majority of participants were NOT anxious about using the Internet, although there were approximately 8% who showed evidence of Internet anxiety. There was a significant and negative relationship between Internet anxiety and Internet use. Those who were more anxious about using the Internet used the Internet less, although the magnitude of effect was small. There was a positive and significant relationship between Internet use and Internet identification. Those who scored high on the measure of Internet identification used the Internet more than those who did not. There was also a significant and negative relationship between Internet anxiety and Internet identification. Finally, males had a significantly higher Internet identification score than females. Implications of these findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Ensuring cyber security is a complex task that relies on domain knowledge and requires cognitive abilities to determine possible threats from large amounts of network data. This study investigates how knowledge in network operations and information security influence the detection of intrusions in a simple network. We developed a simplified Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which allows us to examine how individuals with or without knowledge in cyber security detect malicious events and declare an attack based on a sequence of network events. Our results indicate that more knowledge in cyber security facilitated the correct detection of malicious events and decreased the false classification of benign events as malicious. However, knowledge had less contribution when judging whether a sequence of events representing a cyber-attack. While knowledge of cyber security helps in the detection of malicious events, situated knowledge regarding a specific network at hand is needed to make accurate detection decisions. Responses from participants that have knowledge in cyber security indicated that they were able to distinguish between different types of cyber-attacks, whereas novice participants were not sensitive to the attack types. We explain how these findings relate to cognitive processes and we discuss their implications for improving cyber security.}
